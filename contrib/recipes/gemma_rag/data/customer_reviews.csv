"The service was really fast, probably because I ordered ahead of time.  The taste was typical Data Beans."
I was in and out in no time. The line moved incredibly quickly. The barista even remembered my name when I came back to pick up my latte.
"I go to this location every day and I have consistently had a great experience. The drinks are made quickly and accurately, and the location is very clean and comfortable."
The staff were extremely slow and the service was terrible.  It took over 30 minutes to prepare my drink and it was wrong when I got it.  I will not be returning.
"The coffee here always tastes fresh.  When I'm visiting this location, I like to sit back and enjoy the delicious assortment of flavors."
Coffee is often cold and I have to wait 30+ min in line.
