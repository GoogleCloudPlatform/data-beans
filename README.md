# Data-Beans-Demo

Welcome to Data Beans, a fiticous company that has a fleet of coffee trucks located in cities around the world.  The source code provided here is design to high how you can use GenAI along with BigQuery on Google Cloud.  The code is all working and was used to construct the demo.  The demo consists of a web frontend along with the backend code contained in the project.  To see the frontend, currently is it not deployed as part of the demo, please contact your account team or customer engienner.

This demo is an end to end working demo with all code provided so you can use based upon the contained license agreement.


## Demo Cost
- The demo costs ~ $1 a day to leave idle.
   - You can delete the Colab Runtime if you want to leave idle to mimimize costs.  Just create the runtime when you run the demo.
   - You Colab Enterprise machine storage cost can grow.  If your Colab costs become elevated, delete the Runtime (https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/colab/runtimes) and re-create it based upon the Runtime Template.
- Running the notebooks that perform the GenAI API calls (or BigQuery) cost ~ $1 or so.  It depends how much you run them.  Running them for a few rows of data is mimimal cost; running for thousands will cost more.
- Running the notebooks that perform the Machine Learning training (where you attach a GPU) cost the machine cost and time run.


## Data Generation
- All data in this demo is synthetically generated by LLMs.  
- All images in this demo are generated by GenAI.


# ALERT
# Deploying through Cloud Shell is currently not working correctly
# You will need to deploy from your Local Machine using the steps as below.

## How to deploy
The are two options to deploy the demo depending on your access privilages to your cloud organization

### To deploy to New Project (Requires Elevated Privileges)
- **The following IAM roles are required to deploy the solution**
   - Prerequisite:  Billing Account User (to create the project with billing)
   - Optional:      Folder Editor (if you alter the script to place the project in a folder)
1. Open a Google Cloud Shell: http://shell.cloud.google.com/
2. Type: ```git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/data-beans```
3. Switch the prompt to the directory: ```cd data-beans```
4. Run the deployment script: ```source deploy.sh```
5. Authorize the login (a popup will appear)
6. Follow the prompts: Answer “Yes” for the Terraform approval.


### To deploy to an Existing Project (Requires Assistance from IT and Owner Project Privileges)
- **The following items are required to deploy the solution**
   - Prerequisite: You will need a project created for you (IT can do this for you)
   - Prerequisite: You will need to be an Owner (IAM role) of the project to run the below script
1. Open a Google Cloud Shell: http://shell.cloud.google.com/
2. Type: ```git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/data-beans```
3. Switch the prompt to the directory: ```cd data-beans```
4. Update the hard coded values in ```deploy-use-existing-project-non-org-admin.sh```
5. Run ```source deploy-use-existing-project-non-org-admin.sh```
